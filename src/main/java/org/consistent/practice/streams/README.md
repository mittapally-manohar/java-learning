Here is a list of Java 8 practice questions:

1. **Lambda Expressions**:
    - Write a lambda expression to sort a list of strings by their length. - done
    - Create a lambda expression to filter a list of integers to only include even numbers.

2. **Streams API**:
    - Use the Streams API to find the sum of all even numbers in a list.
    - Convert a list of strings to uppercase using the Streams API.
    - Find the maximum and minimum values in a list of integers using the Streams API.
    - Group a list of strings by their first character using the Streams API.

3. **Optional**:
    - Create an `Optional` object and demonstrate how to use `ifPresent`, `orElse`, and `orElseGet`.
    - Write a method that returns an `Optional` and demonstrate how to handle the absence of a value.

4. **Method References**:
    - Use method references to sort a list of strings.
    - Demonstrate the use of method references for static methods, instance methods, and constructors.

5. **Functional Interfaces**:
    - Implement the `Predicate` interface to filter a list of strings that start with a specific letter.
    - Use the `Function` interface to convert a list of strings to their lengths.
    - Implement the `Supplier` interface to generate a random number.

6. **Default and Static Methods in Interfaces**:
    - Create an interface with a default method and demonstrate its usage.
    - Add a static method to an interface and demonstrate how to call it.

7. **Date and Time API**:
    - Use the new `java.time` package to get the current date and time.
    - Calculate the difference between two dates using the `java.time` package.
    - Format and parse dates using `DateTimeFormatter`.

8. **Collectors**:
    - Use `Collectors.toList()` to collect stream elements into a list.
    - Use `Collectors.joining()` to concatenate a list of strings.
    - Use `Collectors.groupingBy()` to group elements of a stream by a specific criterion.

9. **Parallel Streams**:
    - Convert a sequential stream to a parallel stream and demonstrate the performance difference.
    - Use parallel streams to perform a computation-intensive task.

10. **Map and FlatMap**:
    - Use `map` to transform a list of strings to their lengths.
    - Use `flatMap` to flatten a list of lists into a single list.

These questions cover various aspects of Java 8 features and will help you practice and understand the new functionalities introduced in Java 8.
